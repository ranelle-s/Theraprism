            <p>Theraprism is an easily accessible, private space created for people feeling stressed to take a breather. Put simply, it’s a convenient pop-up tent-like device that uses color and audio therapy to calm and relax the individual residing inside. The walls of the tent contain flexible plastic screens using polyimide (the same kind of screens used in foldable phones) to become extremely heat resistant and bear more than 285,000 folds (medium.com). Thus, it can be folded up into a carrier for easy portability, ready to pop up anytime the user needs their own space to relax. Theraprism uses color therapy as a mild, non-toxic treatment for stress, with the inner screens displaying gentle gradients that change color and calm the resident’s mind. Attached to the outside of the tent are flexible solar panels to charge the technology inside. 
            <br> <br>
            Theraprism is also customizable with the user’s experience, so users may also decide to play a variety of sounds in order to create an additional layer of audio therapy, with outside sounds being blocked out using noise cancellation technology. Options for this include a variety of sounds from nature to general background noise, such as soothing rainfall, crackling bonfire, or simple white noise. Everything from the colors, sounds, and display can be modified right from the user’s phone by using the designated mobile app. In conclusion, all these calming appeals to the senses block out the pressures of the world, and allow the resident to become fully enveloped in the visual and auditory relaxants. They can meditate, lay down, or just sit in silence until they feel rested enough to return to the outside world as a more calm, cool, and collected version of themselves.</p>

                <p>Theraprism combines advanced technology from several different regions of innovation: holograms, flexible screens, and resting capsule equipment. Starting all the way from before the 20th century, it can be seen that the hardware behind Theraprism has come a long way. The progression the very first CRT to the Hololens glasses has allowed Theraprism to build upon these concepts even further in a form not yet attempted before until now.

                <p>Chromotherapy is a method of treatment that uses the visible colors of electromagnetic radiation to cure diseases which is also called vibration healing. These visual colors with their unique wavelength and oscillations, when combined with a light source and selectively applied to impaired organs or life systems, provide the necessary healing energy required by the body.</p>

             <p>Sound therapy, in which auditory and vibratory inputs are used to influence a person's physiological and/or psychological state, includes sound healing, vibro-acoustic sound therapy, music, and music therapy. Practitioners of sound healing may use chimes, chanting, or drumming to create particular sound frequencies at specific intervals in an eort to promote health and healing of the mind and body.</p>

            <p>Hannah is a chemical engineering major at San José State University. She goes to the Library in an attempt to study for an upcoming test that has been weighing down on her mind. At the library, she becomes overwhelmed and frustrated when she doesn’t understand the material she’s studying. She turns to her backpack and takes out her Theraprism tent carrier that fits inside easily, retrieves the product inside, and props the device up to crawl inside. 
                <br> <br>
            Within the tent, it’s quiet and serene with its outside noise cancellation technology, and connects to her phone with just a few taps. She taps on the Rainfall setting, to which the tent surrounds her in a deep blue hue of light and a hologram display of raindrops falling gently around her appears. After just 15 minutes of immersion in this therapeutic experience, Hannah exits, folds the tentback up with ease, and returns to her studying, greatly calmed and more focused than she was before.</p> </div>

            <p>Oliver is a Senior Art Director working at Google. He begins another meeting with his artists discussing the upcoming topics that need to be planned out. The meeting doesn't go well with barely ideas being created and it feels like a block in creativity by the end of it. Anxious for the deadlines to be met, he excuses himself and returns to his office. He picks up the product placed by his desk, easily assembles it, and sits himself inside. 
                <br> <br>
            Being inside the tent feels like he’s transported into another world, and he sighs in relief at the change in pace. Looking through the mobile app, he sets his screens up to display the Beach setting. Gradients of orange and purple appear with the subtle motions of holographic waves above his ankles. He closes his eyes for 30 minutes and by the time he comes out of the tent, he feels refreshed and as light as ever, with many new ideas to think about.</p> </div>
